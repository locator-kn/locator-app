# locator-app
This is the Website http://project.locator-app.com/. The site explains the background of the 
[Locator](https://github.com/locator-kn/ark) Project and is used for pre registering and sending feedback.

It only works with a little nodejs backend [dove](https://github.com/locator-kn/dove), which will handle the registration and
receiving feedback
